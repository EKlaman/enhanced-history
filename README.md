A note for the curious
======================

This is a fork `Better History`, which was sold by the original author and had hijack links added to it.
All hijacks have been removed, and permissions restored.

* Work is in progress to make this a **fully offline** extension to avoid such complications.

Enhanced History for Chrome
===========================

Chrome is an excellent browser, but browsing your history kinda stinks.

Getting rolling
----------------

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the repo's directory as an extension

Any changes you make to your cloned repo will be seen immediately in the installed extension. Though sometimes changing translation files (in _locales/) requires a manual extension refresh in Chrome's extension settings.
